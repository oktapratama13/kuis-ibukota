My First Web Project 
Geography quiz built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is my very first website.  passion project that blends my love for metal music, futuristic aesthetics, and learning the fundamentals of web development.
Challenge yourself to guess the capitals of all 193 unrecognized countries across three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. No frameworks, no libraries. Just raw code, curiosity, and a headbanging spirit.
Built by a first semester Informatics student who believes every great developer starts with a single line of code. ðŸ¤˜
